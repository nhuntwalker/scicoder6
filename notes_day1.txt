	- Ivelina Momcheva (Yale)
	- John Parejko (Yale)
	- Adrian Price-Whelan (Columbia)
	- Erik Tollerund (Yale)

Optimize your code
	"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth
	Write your code to work first. Optimize later

Profiling:
	Let the computer tell you where it spends most of its time

Software Usability (UX)
	"Don't Make Me Think." - Steve Krug
	Basically, when someone's trying to use your product they want it to just work, be easily read, an be easily understood.

Aims:
	- Improving your work environemnt
	- Good programming practices
	- Show you how to design and program against a DB
	- Start to separate "programming" from details of "syntax"
	- Apply what you are learning to a real research project

Languages
	• Scripted
		- The code you write is run by an interpreter, line by line
		- Syntax errors are found when the interpreter hits that line
		- The text file is the program
		- Much faster to write and experiment in
		- Slower than compiled languages
		- Ex: python, perl, JS, shell

	• Compiled
		- The code you write must be compiled, e.g. turned into machine code
		- Syntax errors wil prevent the program from being compiled
		- Slower to develop (must compile, link, run)
		- Programs are faster (generally, but not necessarily)
		- Syntax is typically not very clean
		- Good for low-level programming when you need fine control of memory or direct access to hardware
		- Ex: C, C++, Fortran, Java

========= Slides Sent; From here on just notes ===========
Should really wean self off of sublime text. Should be able to execute code directly from the editor. Also should be aware of functions.

Text Wrangler might be a good option. Also, consider using Komodo for big python projects (haven't really done any big ones yet but yeah).

Evernote as an "everything box" for saving small snippets of information (code, reminders, urls, w/e); syncs across different devices

Create a config file for ssh.

Markdown: a markup langauge that is easy to read, even with the markup "code".
	- http://mouapp.com as a markdown editor on mac
	- consider using markdown to write the outline for apps instead of...word...
	- plugin for quicklook to render markdown
	- may or may not recognize tabs instead of spaces (4 spaces for "tabbed" indentation)
